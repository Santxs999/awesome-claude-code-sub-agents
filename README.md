# Awesome Claude Code Agents 🤖

A comprehensive collection of specialized Claude Code agents for software development, designed as **expert consultants** that provide architectural guidance, decision frameworks, and best practices. Each agent focuses on helping you make informed technology choices and design decisions rather than generating code.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setting Up Claude Code Agents

1. **Install Claude Code**: Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/installation)

2. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/supatest-ai/awesome-claude-code-agents.git
   cd awesome-claude-code-agents
   ```

3. **Copy agent files**: Copy the agent `.md` files to your Claude Code agents directory:
   ```bash
   cp */*.md ~/.config/claude-code/agents/
   ```

4. **Verify installation**: List available agents:
   ```bash
   claude-code agents list
   ```

### How to Use Agents

Claude Code agents can be invoked in several ways:

1. **Automatic Invocation**: Agents with `PROACTIVELY` in their description will be automatically invoked based on context
2. **Manual Invocation**: Use `@agent-name` in your messages to explicitly invoke an agent
3. **Task-Specific**: Agents will be suggested based on the files you're working with and the tasks you're performing

For more details, see the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## ✨ What Makes These Agents Different

### 🎯 **Decision-Focused Architecture**
Unlike traditional code-generation agents, our agents are designed as **specialized consultants** that help you make informed architectural and technology decisions:

```
Traditional Agents:          Our Agents:
"Here's React code"    →     "When to choose React vs Vue vs Angular"
"FastAPI example"      →     "Django vs FastAPI vs Flask decision matrix"  
"Docker config"        →     "Containerization strategy and patterns"
"AWS Lambda code"      →     "Serverless vs container deployment decisions"
```

### 📊 **Research-Based Design**
Based on analysis of successful Claude Code agent repositories, our agents follow proven patterns:

- **300-800 lines**: Focused, actionable content (vs 2000+ line tutorials)
- **80/20 Guidance/Code**: Decision frameworks over implementations
- **Production-Ready**: Enterprise patterns and real-world considerations  
- **Model-Optimized**: Sonnet for complex decisions, Haiku for simple tasks

### 🏗️ **Architectural Consultant Approach**
Each agent acts as a domain expert consultant providing:

- **Technology Selection**: When/why to choose specific tools and frameworks
- **Architecture Patterns**: System design and structural decisions
- **Performance Optimization**: Scaling strategies and bottleneck identification  
- **Best Practices**: Security, maintainability, and operational excellence

## 🛠️ Agent YAML Format

All agents follow the Claude Code subagent format with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description with PROACTIVELY keyword for auto-invocation
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, MultiEdit
---
```

### Required Fields:
- **name**: Unique identifier for the agent (kebab-case)
- **description**: Clear description of agent capabilities and when to use it
- **tools**: List of Claude Code tools the agent can access

### Best Practices:
- Use `PROACTIVELY` in description for agents that should be auto-invoked
- Be specific about when and how the agent should be used
