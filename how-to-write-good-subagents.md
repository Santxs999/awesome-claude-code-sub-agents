# How to Write Good Claude Code Sub-Agents

*Simple principles for creating effective specialized AI assistants*

## The 5 Core Principles (From Anthropic)

1. **Start with Claude-generated agents** - Generate initial subagent with Claude, then customize
2. **Design focused subagents** - Single, clear responsibilities only  
3. **Write detailed prompts** - Include specific instructions, examples, constraints
4. **Limit tool access** - Only grant necessary tools
5. **Version control** - Check project subagents into git for team collaboration

## Basic Structure

```yaml
---
name: your-agent-name
description: When this subagent should be invoked
tools: [optional-tool-list]
---

Your system prompt goes here.
Define role, capabilities, and approach clearly.
Include specific instructions and constraints.
```

## Writing Effective System Prompts

### Be Specific and Detailed
```
❌ "You are a code reviewer"
✅ "You are a senior code reviewer specializing in Python. 
   Focus on security vulnerabilities, performance issues, 
   and PEP 8 compliance. Always suggest specific fixes."
```

### Single Responsibility 
```
❌ "Handle frontend and backend and testing"
✅ "Specialized React component reviewer focused on 
   accessibility, performance, and reusability"
```

### Include Context and Examples
```
✅ "When reviewing API endpoints, check for:
   - Proper error handling (try/catch blocks)
   - Input validation and sanitization  
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - Consistent response formats"
```

## Description Field Best Practices

### Make It Delegation-Friendly
```yaml
# Help Claude know when to use this agent
description: "Use proactively for all React component reviews and optimization"
description: "MUST BE USED when analyzing database performance issues"
description: "Expert in Node.js API security - invoke for backend code review"
```

## Common Templates

### Code Reviewer
```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Use proactively for comprehensive code analysis
tools: [read, edit]
---

You are a senior software engineer with expertise in code review.
Focus on: security, performance, maintainability, and best practices.
Always provide specific, actionable feedback with code examples.
```

### Test Runner
```yaml
---
name: test-runner  
description: Use to run tests and fix failures automatically
---

You are a test automation expert. When you see code changes:
1. Run appropriate tests proactively
2. If tests fail, analyze root cause
3. Fix failures while preserving test intent
4. Report results clearly
```

### Performance Optimizer
```yaml
---
name: performance-optimizer
description: Use for database queries and system performance analysis
---

You are a performance optimization specialist.
Analyze bottlenecks, suggest specific improvements.
Focus on: query optimization, caching strategies, resource usage.
Measure before/after performance impact.
```

## Key Writing Tips

### Context Is Everything
> "When you're working with a new grad with amnesia, write out all the context you have in your head. The more context you give Claude, the more effective it'll be."

### Remember Patterns
> "If you remember 'there's a similar pattern we've used for this type of problem in this codebase', write it down!"

### Start Small
> "Don't build 20-30 agents at once. Notice when you're repeating a task, and create an agent in that moment."

## What Makes Agents Actually Get Used

### Proactive Language
- "Use proactively"
- "MUST BE USED"  
- "Automatically invoke when..."

### Clear Boundaries
- One specific domain expertise
- Obvious trigger conditions
- Well-defined scope

### Practical Value
- Solves real recurring problems
- Faster than doing manually
- Preserves context and reduces switching

## Simple Examples That Work

```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
description: Use for any security-related code analysis
---

Security specialist focused on OWASP vulnerabilities.
Scan for: SQL injection, XSS, auth bypasses, data exposure.
Provide specific remediation steps.
```

```yaml
---
name: api-designer
description: Use when designing or reviewing REST APIs
---

API design expert following REST principles.
Focus on: resource naming, HTTP methods, status codes,
error handling, documentation, versioning strategies.
```

```yaml  
---
name: database-architect
description: Use for database schema and query optimization
---

Database specialist for schema design and optimization.
Analyze: normalization, indexing, query performance,
migration strategies, data integrity constraints.
```

## The Golden Rule

**Write prompts like you're onboarding a smart junior developer who needs explicit context about your codebase, patterns, and preferences.**
